# ðŸŽµ Music Track Manager

This is a full-stack project where I built an application to manage music tracks. It lets you add, edit, view, and delete tracks using a custom API I created with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I also built a simple frontend using React so users can easily interact with the backend.

- Add new music tracks (title, artist, genre, duration)
- View all tracks in a list
- Edit or delete any existing track
- Everything is stored in a MongoDB database
- Tested the backend using Thunder Client
